Input, run, and postprocessing scripts for the publication "Chiral phonons in metal--organic frameworks as quantum sensors for the direct detection of dark matter" by Carl P. Roman and Marek Matas.

This code is built on the Phonodark code by Tanner Trickle et al.:

https://github.com/tanner-trickle/PhonoDark
https://phonodark.caltech.edu/

In order to run this code, please follow all the instructions listed in the repository of the original Phonodark code.

Then, run the run.sh files after modifying the listed paths.

After that, the .hdf5 files will be created. Then the plotting macro can be run to produce exclusion limits.

In case any problems are encountered, please contact me directly through the email marek.matas@fjfi.cvut.cz
